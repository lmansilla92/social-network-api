# Social Network API

## Repository

In this repository you will find the application code to a Social Network API. The purpose of this application is to connect to a MongoDB and have the ability to create users, thoughts, and reactions as well as add, and remove friends. Thoughts have the ability to be deleted and updated and users can be deleted and updated as well. This application uses express, mongoose, and moment as dependencies to provide the features avaiable. Moment helps us format the time stamps of thoughts and reactions while mongoose serves as the object modeling for node.js to help us use MongoDB as our database.
